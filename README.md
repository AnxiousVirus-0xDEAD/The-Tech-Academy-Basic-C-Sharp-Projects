# The Tech Academy Basic C-Sharp Projects

Welcome to my repository for projects completed during The Tech Academy's coursework!

This repository serves as a collection of my foundational C# programming exercises and projects, demonstrating my progress and understanding of core concepts taught in the program. As I advance through the curriculum, I will continuously update this repository with new projects, code refinements, and improvements.

This is an active portfolio showcasing my journey in software development.
